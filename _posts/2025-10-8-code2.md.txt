## 📘 What Is Regression?

Regression is a predictive modeling technique used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It helps:

- **Identify Relationships**: Linear or non-linear patterns between variables.
- **Fit Models**: Use mathematical functions to minimize prediction errors.
- **Make Predictions**: Apply learned relationships to new data.
- **Evaluate Performance**: Assess accuracy and generalization.

## 🧹 Preparing Your Dataset for Regression

Before building a regression model, data preparation is essential:

### 🔍 Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values (e.g., imputation).
- Remove duplicates.
- Correct errors and outliers.

### 🔄 Data Transformation
- Normalize or standardize features.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).

### 🧠 Feature Selection & Engineering
- Remove irrelevant features.
- Use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Create or transform features to improve model performance.

### 🧪 Splitting the Data
- Train-test split (e.g., 80/20).
- Use cross-validation to reduce overfitting.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and relationships.
- Check assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality.

## 🧪 Practicing Regression in Python

Here’s a basic regression example using `scikit-learn`:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Linear
